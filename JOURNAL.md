## 10/5/2025 - Researched parts  

For the past little while, I've been researching parts and exactly what I need to make a truly beginner-friendly yet super fast printer. My ideal with this printer is a bedslinger with Bambu Lab ease-of-use and CoreXY speeds. Of course, a DIY printer can't really get as easy to make as a Bambu Lab, due to the lack of custom parts, etc. But I'm sure going to try.

Essentially, what I'm aiming for is a printer I can sell. Again because I don't have access to bulk manufactured parts from a dedicated factory I'm not going to be able to sell it cheaper than say a Bambu Lab A1 Mini, but if I'm able to pull this off, people will be buying a fully open-source, super fast version of it.

Anyways, I've researched a bunch so far, and for the most part I'm proud of what I've found. As of right now, I'm dreadfully overbudget, but that might be because I put way too much into aluminum extrusions. I hope to get sponsored by LDO and PCBWay, and possibly Polymaker or BigTreeTech to cut down on out-of-pocket costs. I spent way too long trying to research a CPAP cooling system, when I didn't realize that they cost at least $70. That being out of my budget, I think I've decided to use dual 5020 fans instead. We'll see how it turns out!
