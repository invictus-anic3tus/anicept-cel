## 10/5/2025 - Researched parts  

For the past little while, I've been researching parts and exactly what I need to make a truly beginner-friendly yet super fast printer. My ideal with this printer is a bedslinger with Bambu Lab ease-of-use and CoreXY speeds. Of course, a DIY printer can't really get as easy to make as a Bambu Lab, due to the lack of custom parts, etc. But I'm sure going to try.

Essentially, what I'm aiming for is a printer I can sell. Again because I don't have access to bulk manufactured parts from a dedicated factory I'm not going to be able to sell it cheaper than say a Bambu Lab A1 Mini, but if I'm able to pull this off, people will be buying a fully open-source, super fast version of it.

Anyways, I've researched a bunch so far, and for the most part I'm proud of what I've found. As of right now, I'm dreadfully overbudget, but that might be because I put way too much into aluminum extrusions. I hope to get sponsored by LDO and PCBWay, and possibly Polymaker or BigTreeTech to cut down on out-of-pocket costs. I spent way too long trying to research a CPAP cooling system, when I didn't realize that they cost at least $70. That being out of my budget, I think I've decided to use dual 5020 fans instead. We'll see how it turns out!

## 10/6/2025 - Began CAD  

Today I started to CAD the toolhead a bit. I did a bit more research, but I think I'm gonna get started on the printhead just to make sure I'm not forgetting anything or something like that. I'm using the ProtoExtruder 2.0, the Peopoly Magneto X Lancer Melt Zone standard hotend, dual 5020 part cooling fans, a 4010 heat creep fan, a CRTouch probe, and possibly linear rails, but I may have to switch to rods for budget problems.

## 10/8/2025 - More Printhead CAD  

Today I did a bunch of CAD! I locked in and was able to get a ton of stuff done. I arranged all my printhead parts in a way I think will work really well, and began to make the 3D printed parts. I've decided to put the ABL probe (CR Touch) in the front, which is fairly unusual, but the idea is that it lets me keep the hotend and extruder as close to the X-axis linear rods as possible to minimize the effects of linear bearing play and to distribute the weight better. In moving the CR Touch, I had to mount the heat creep fan at a 45 degree angle, but I think it looks cool so I like it. Finally, moving the probe gives me more room to put a possible toolhead PCB.

Last but not least, I huddled with Gabriel (@gbtsui) and gave him some tips and tricks on how to make a printer, cuz he's making his first CoreXY! Fun stuff.
